            <li class="two-columns__paragraph">Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself.
              We often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the test.
              But once the test is over, that information has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be retained.
              In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests.

              So, what can we do to remedy this?
